# Statistics-Library
A set of useful statistics methods for Python dependent on Numpy, Sympy, and Matplotlib. 
Methods include graphing, integration, and comparison for the normal, student-t, and chi-squared distributions.   

You must install by downloading/cloning the statistics.py file (no pip).  

example method calls: graphT_CDF(-1,1,3), graphNormalComparison(1, 1.3, .1)

Take a look through the file to optimize and fully utilize the library using the default parameters (like upperBound, lowerBound).

Please let me know in the issues tab if you have any concerns/requests!
